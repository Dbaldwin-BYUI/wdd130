                            Taking care of your garden is sometimes 
                            a chore. With ongoing advances in 
                            technology, gardening has numerous products 
                            that can help you with your garden. The tertill 
                            is solar powered robot designed to find and cut 
                            weeds in your garden. The tertill can keep 
                            gardens free of weed up to 200 square feet. 
                            After roaming around and clearing weeds, it 
                            switches to a charging mode until it has 
                            recharged the battery. With built in parameters 
                            to prevent it from going outside its working area 
                            and sensors that prevent it from driving over or 
                            cutting your plants.

                        Another technological help for gardening is the farmbot. 
                        This does great at getting rid of weeds, but can plant seeds and 
                        water your plants automaticly for you as well. For people 
                        who want to have a garden and have busy schedules or leave 
                        for extended times such as vacations, this can keep your garden 
                        maintained for you. The farmbot also monitors the soil and 
                        comes with an app that you can use to control the robotic 
                        arm and atatched tools with.
